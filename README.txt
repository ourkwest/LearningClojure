A project to assist my learning of Clojure.

Includes:

1) A fratal plotter using iterative complex mathematics.

Run 
(load-file "<path_to_git_repo>/fractal.clj") 
at the Clojure REPL to plot a Julia set.
The image will currently be spat out at "C:\Coding\temp". 

2) A branching tree fractal plotter.

Run 
(load-file "<path_to_git_repo>/flower.clj") 
at the Clojure REPL to plot a squiggely pattern.
The image will currently be viewable at "deleteme.html" in the user directory (as determined by the JVM).
